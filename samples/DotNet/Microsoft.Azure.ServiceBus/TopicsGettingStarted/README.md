# Getting Started with Service Bus Topics

This sample shows how to interact with the essential API elements for interacting with a Service Bus *Topic*.

The sample is nearly identical to the [QueuesGettingStarted](../QueuesGettingStarted) sample since 
the API gestures for interacting with *Queues* and *Topics* are largely the same. In this document we will 
therefore focus on the few differences between the samples. 

## Prerequisites and Setup

Refer to the main [README](../README.md) document for setup instructions. All samples share and require the same setup
before they can be run.

## Sample Code 

The sample is documented inline in the [Program.cs](Program.cs) C# file.

# Azure Service Bus samples

## .NET

### Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus
Any samples within the `Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus` folder target the newer .NET Standard library. Each of the sample page carries a description of the scenario covered in the sample
under the `What will be accomplished` section.

### Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging
Any samples within the `Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging` folder, reference the older `WindowsAzure.ServiceBus` NuGet package. These samples were moved from [this previous repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-servicebus-messaging-samples). See the readme [here](./DotNet/Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging/README.md) for more details. 

## Java
Any samples within the `Java` folder target the new [Azure-ServiceBus-Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus-java) library. See the readme [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus/blob/master/samples/Java/readme.md) for more details on the scenario covered in the samples.

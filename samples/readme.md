## .Net Getting Started

The samples in the [GettingStarted](DotNet/GettingStarted) are holding a set of quick starts and a set of other very basic samples to get you started with using Azure Service Bus.

## .NET Standard

The samples in the
[Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus](DotNet/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus) folder target
the .NET Standard client package. New applications should use this package over
the previous client. 

## .NET Framework

The samples in the
[Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging](DotNet/Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging) folder
target the .NET Framework `WindowsAzure.ServiceBus` NuGet package, which is
maintained for backwards compatibility.

## Java

The samples within the [Java](Java) folder target the
[azure-service-bus-java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus-java)
package and the [Apache Qpid JMS 2.0](https://qpid.apache.org/components/jms/)
client. Additionally all newly added Quickstarts and Tutorials for Java will be available [here](Java/quickstarts-and-tutorials).

## Management

The samples within the [Management](Management) folder show basic management operations with PowerShell, Azure CLI and .Net.
